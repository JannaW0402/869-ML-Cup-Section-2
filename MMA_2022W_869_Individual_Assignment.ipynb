He wants to know the main types of *customer personas*. Once he knows these, he will contemplate ways to better market to each persona, better satisfy each persona, better cater to each persona, increase the loyalty of each persona, etc. But first, he must know the personas.\n",
        "\n",
        "You want to help Uncle Steve. Using sneaky magic (and the help of Environics), you've collected four useful features for a subset of the customers: age, income, spending score (i.e., a score based on how much they’ve spent at the store in total), and savings (i.e., how much money they have in their personal bank account). \n",

        "1. Pick a clustering algorithm (the [`sklearn.cluster`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.cluster) module has many good choices, including [`KMeans`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans), [`DBSCAN`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html#sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN), and [`AgglomerativeClustering`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html#sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering) (aka Hierarchical). (Note that another popular implementation of the hierarchical algorithm can be found in SciPy's [`scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html).) Don't spend a lot of time thinking about which algorithm to choose - just pick one. Cluster the customers as best as you can, within reason. That is, try different feature preprocessing steps, hyperparameter values, and/or distance metrics. You don't need to try every single posssible combination, but try a few at least. Measure how good each  model configuration is by calculating an internal validation metric (e.g., [`calinski_harabasz_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.calinski_harabasz_score.html) or [`silhouette_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html#sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score)).\n",
        "2. You have some doubts - you're not sure if the algorithm you chose in part 1 is the best algorithm for this dataset/problem. Neither is Uncle Steve. So, choose a different algorithm (any!) and do it all again.\n",
        "3. Which clustering algorithm is \"better\" in this case? Think about charateristics of the algorithm like quality of results, ease of use, speed, interpretability, etc. Choose a winner and justify to Uncle Steve.\n",
        "4. Interpret the clusters of the winning model. That is, describe, in words, a *persona* that accurately depicts each cluster. Use statistics (e.g., cluster means/distributions), examples (e.g., exemplar instances from each cluster), and/or visualizations (e.g., relative importance plots, snakeplots) to get started. Human judgement and creativity will be necessary. This is where it all comes together. Be descripive and *help Uncle Steve understand his customers better*. Please!\n",

        "- Since clustering is an unsupervised ML technique, you don't need to split the data into training/validation/test or anything like that. Phew!\n",
        "- On the flip side, since clustering is unsupervised, you will never know the \"true\" clusters, and so you will never know if a given algorithm is \"correct.\" There really is no notion of \"correctness\" - only \"usefullness.\"\n",
        "- Many online clustering tutorials (including some from Uncle Steve) create flashy visualizations of the clusters by plotting the instances on a 2-D graph and coloring each point by the cluster ID. This is really nice and all, but it can only work if your dataset only has exactly two features - no more, no less. This dataset has more than two features, so you cannot use this technique. (But that's OK - you don't need to use this technique.) \n",
        "- Must you use all four features in the clustering? Not necessarily, no. But \"throwing away\" quality data, for no reason, is unlikely to improve a model.\n",
        "- Some people have success applying a dimensionality reduction technique (like [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)) to the features before clustering. You may do this if you wish, although it may not be as helpful in this case because there are only four features to begin with.\n",
        "- If you apply a transformation (e.g., [`MinMaxScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) or [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler)) to the features before clustering, you may have difficulty interpretting the means of the clusters (e.g., what is a mean Age of 0.2234??). There are two options to fix this: first, you can always reverse a transformation with the `inverse_transform` method. Second, you can just use the original dataset (i.e., before any prepropoceesing) during the interpreation step.\n",
        "- You cannot change the distance metric for K-Means. (This is for theoretical reasons: K-Means only works/makes sense with Euclidean distance.\n"

        "\n",
        "Uncle Steve runs a small, local grocery store in Ontario. The store sells all the normal food staples (e.g., bread, milk, cheese, eggs, more cheese, fruits, vegatables, meat, fish, waffles, ice cream, pasta, cereals, drinks), personal care products (e.g., toothpaste, shampoo, hair goo), medicine, and cakes. There's even a little section with flowers and greeting cards! Normal people shop here, and buy normal things in the normal way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business is OK but Uncle Steve wants more. He's thus on the hunt for customer insights. Given your success at the jewelry store, he has asked you to help him out. \n",
        "\n",
        "He has given you a few years' worth of customer transactions, i.e., sets of items that customers have purchased. You have applied an association rules learning algorithm (like Apriori) to the data, and the algorithm has generated a large set of association rules of the form `{X} -> {Y}`, where `{X}` and `{Y}` are item-sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now comes a thought experiment. For each of the following scenarios, state what one of the discovered association rules might be that would meet the stated condition. (Just make up the rule, using your human experience and intuition.) Also, describe whether and why each rule would be considered interesting or uninteresting for Uncle Steve (i.e., is this insight new to him? Would he be able to use it somehow?).\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep each answer to 600 characters or less (including spaces).\n",
        "\n",
        "To get those brain juices going, an example condition and answer is provided below:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Condition: A rule that has high support.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Answer: The rule `{milk} -> {bread}` would have high support, since milk and bread are household staples and a high percentage of transactions would include both `{milk}` and `{bread}`. Uncle Steve would likely not find this rule interesting, because these items are so common, he would have surely already noticed that so many transactions contain them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Marking**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your responses will be marked as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Correctness*. Rule meets the specificed condition, and seems plausible in an Ontario grocery store.\n",
        "- *Justification of interestness*. Response clearly describes whether and why the rule would be considered interesting to Uncle Steve.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tips**\n",
        "\n",
        "- There is no actual data for this question. This question is just a thought exercise. You need to use your intuition, creatitivty, and understanding of the real world. I assume you are familiar with what happens inside of normal grocery stores. We are not using actual data and you do not need to create/generate/find any data. I repeat: there is no data for this question.\n",
        "- The reason this question is having you do a thought experiment, rather than writing and running code to find actual association rules on an actual dataset, is because writing code to find association rules is actually pretty easy. But using your brain to come up with rules that meet certain criteria, on the other hand, is a true test of whether you understand how the algorithm works, what support and confidence mean, and the applicability of rules. The question uses the grocery store context because most, if not all, students should be familiar from personal experience.\n",

        "\n",
        "You are to create a classification model to predict whether a loan applicant has good risk or bad risk. You will use data  that Uncle Steve bought from another credit union (somewhere in Europe, he thinks?) that has around 6000 instances and a number of demographics features (e.g., `Sex`, `DateOfBirth`, `Married`), loan details (e.g., `Amount`, `Purpose`), credit history (e.g., number of loans), as well as an indicator (called `BadCredit` in the dataset) as to whether that person was a bad risk.\n",

        "**Your tasks**\n",
        "\n",
        "To examine the effects of the various ML stages, you are to create the model several times, each time adding more sophistication, and measuring how much the model improved (or not). In particular, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "0. Split the data in training and testing. Don't touch the testing data again, for any reason, until step 5. We are pretending that the testing data is \"future, unseen data that our model won't see until production.\" I'm serious, don't touch it. I'm watching you!\n",
        "1. Build a baseline model - no feature engineering, no feature selection, no hyperparameter tuning (just use the default settings), nothing fancy. (You may need to do some basic feature transformations, e.g., encoding of categorical features, or dropping of features you do not think will help or do not want to deal with yet.) Measure the performance using K-fold cross validation (recommended: [`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html#sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score)) on the training data. Use at least 5 folds, but more are better. Choose a [`scoring` parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter) (i.e., classification metric) that you feel is appropriate for this task. Don't use accuracy. Print the mean score of your model.\n",
        "2. Add a bit of feature engineering. The [`sklearn.preprocessing`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing) module contains many useful transformations. Engineer at least three new features. They don't need to be especially ground-breaking or complicated. Dimensionality reduction techniques like [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) are fair game but not required. (If you do use dimensionality reduction techniques, it would only count as \"one\" new feature for the purposes of this assignment, even though I realize that PCA creates many new \"features\" (i.e., principal componentns).) Re-train your baseline model. Measure performance. Compare to step 1.\n",
        "3. Add feature selection. The [`sklearn.feature_selection`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_selection) has some algorithms for you to choose from. After selecting features, re-train your model, measure performance, and compare to step 2.\n",
        "4. Add hyperparameter tuning. Make reasonable choices and try to find the best (or at least, better) hyperparameters for your estimator and/or transformers. It's probably a good idea to stop using `cross_val_score` at this point and start using [`sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) as it is specifically built for this purpose and is more convienient to use. Measure performance and compare to step 3.\n",
        "5. Finally, estimate how well your model will work in production. Use the testing data (our \"future, unseen data\") from step 0. Transform the data as appropriate (easy if you've built a pipeline, a little more difficult if not), use the model from step 4 to get predictions, and measure the performance.

        "- There is no minimum accuracy/precision/recall for this question. I.e., your mark will not be based on how good your model is. Rather, you mark will be based on good your process is.\n",
        "- Watch out for data leakage and overfitting. In particular, be sure to `fit()` any estimators and transformers (collectively, *objects*) only to the training data, and then use the objects' `transform()` methods on both the training and testing data. [Data School](https://www.youtube.com/c/dataschool/featured) has a [helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2XsZdwbCCs) about this. [Pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y6O9nCo0-I) are very helpful here and make your code shorter and more robust (at the expense of making it harder to understand), and I recommend using them, but they are not required for this assignment.\n",
        "- Create as many code cells as you need. In general, each cell should do one \"thing.\"\n",
